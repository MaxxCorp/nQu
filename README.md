- public: for now, all public resources availalbe at HTTP root go here. Some will move to their Zend2(current plan) view asset locations later
- public/js/vendor: put all libs here, backbone.js, etc. which not loaded from CDNs. require.js added as a start - AWD loading should perhaps be better implemented via Dojo-Toolkit
- public/assets: added a quick placeholder, useful for inital testing
